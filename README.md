kellyelton.devenvironment
=======================

## I'm migrating away from this approach becaue chocolatey doesn't really like things like this. So I'm converting this over to BoxStarter. 
## Here's the gist https://gist.github.com/kellyelton/de8b5995912c5b22042e5196cf55016c



http://chocolatey.org/packages/kellyelton.devenvironment

# To Install It
* Install Chocolatey (http://chocolatey.org/)
* Open Powershell(admin)
* Run `set-executionpolicy remotesigned`
* Run `cinst kellyelton.devenvironment`
* You're good to go.
